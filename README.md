# 7DTD-A19-DMTMods

A collection of DMT mods for 7 Days to Die Alpha 19 - All are tested and currently working on A19.3 b6

I used the latest release of DMT(currently v2.2.7) which can be found here: https://github.com/HAL-NINE-THOUSAND/DMT/releases

DMT is now built with the latest Harmony dll(currently version 2.0.2).
