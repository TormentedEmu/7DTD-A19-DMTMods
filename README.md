# 7DTD-A19-DMTMods
A collection of DMT mods for 7 Days to Die Alpha 19 - All are tested and working on A19.2 b4

I used the latest release of DMT(currently v2.1) which can be found here: https://github.com/HAL-NINE-THOUSAND/DMT/releases

DMT is now built with the latest Harmony dll(currently version 2.0.2).
